# 🔐 Secure Bootloader Simulation (AES + RSA) - C + Python

This project demonstrates a secure bootloader written in C, simulating a firmware validation and decryption process using:

- **AES-128 in CBC mode** for decryption
- **RSA-2048** for digital signature verification
- A **Python tool** to encrypt and sign the firmware
- Executable in **WSL/Linux**, no physical hardware required
